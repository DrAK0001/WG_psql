# WG_psql
Bash script that generates WireGuard keys, prompts for an IP address, fetches the hostname, and sends this data to a remote PostgreSQL database.
Replace "your_host", "your_username", "your_database", "your_table" with your PostgreSQL database details. Ensure you have the psql command line tool installed and configured to interact with your database.
